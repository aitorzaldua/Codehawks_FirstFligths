## What is a CodeHawks First Flight?

First Flights are 7 days long smart contracts auditing challenges characterised by smaller codebases and different rewards mechanisms from our standard smart contract auditing competitions, making them the perfect testing and learning ground for any aspirant smart contract security auditor.

Every week a new First Flight is announced and will be available on CodeHawks to join for 7 days.

Differently from the CodeHawks smart contract auditing competitions, First Flights do not come with monetary prize pools but grant participants a multiplier on the XP earned by submitting findings.
