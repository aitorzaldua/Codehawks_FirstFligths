## [LOW - Gas Saving] Set variables as immutables

### Severity

LOW - Gas Saving

### Date Modified

Oct 30th, 2023

### Summary

To Set the variables which value will no change during the contract helps to sabe a lot of gas

### Vulnerability Details

In Solidity, variables which are not intended to be updated should be constant or immutable.

The Solidity compiler does not reserve a storage slot for constant or immutable variables and instead replaces every occurrence of these variables with their assigned value in the contractâ€™s bytecode so we do not need to do SLOAD operations to access these variables.

Variables affected:

`raffleDuration`

`raffleStartTime`

### Impact

Just Gas saving

### Tools Used

Foundry, manual

### Recommendations

Set `raffleDuration` and `raffleStartTime` as immutables.
